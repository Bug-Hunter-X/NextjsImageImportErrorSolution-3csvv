# Next.js Image Import Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where image imports fail in specific page components. The error arises when attempting to render an image using a relative path within the component.

## Problem

In the `pages/about.js` file, an attempt to import an image using a relative path `src="/images/profile.jpg" ` fails at runtime. The error message typically indicates a failure to find the image at the specified path. This often occurs due to how Next.js handles image imports and static asset resolution.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper image import within the Next.js framework.  This can be achieved by using the `next/image` component, correctly configuring the image path, or employing a suitable image optimization solution.

The solution is provided in `aboutSolution.js`.
